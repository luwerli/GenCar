# 🗺️ CartoGen – Automatic Cartographic Generalization
**Overview**

GenCar is a modular Python framework for automated multi-scale topographic generalization with explicit topological constraints and quantitative spatial validation.

The system was designed to bridge traditional cartographic theory with reproducible geospatial data engineering workflows.

Target scale transition: 1:25,000 → 1:50,000

**Problem Statement**

Multi-scale topographic map production requires:

- Structured feature selection rules
- Morphological preservation
- Hydrographic-topographic consistency
- Controlled geometric simplification

Traditional manual generalization is:

- Labor-intensive
- Difficult to standardize
- Hard to reproduce
- Not scalable for national mapping systems

Additionally, conventional simplification algorithms often break:
- Contour–river intersections
- Topological continuity
- Morphological integrity

GenCar proposes an automated, topology-aware generalization methodology to address these limitations.

**Solution Architecture**

The workflow is structured into modular processing stages:

1. Scale-Based Feature Selection

- Original contour interval: 10m
- Target interval: 20m
- Elevation modulus filtering

✔ Reduces visual density
✔ Preserves structural morphology

2. Hydrographic Influence Modeling

- Buffer generation around drainage network
- Identification of contour–river interaction zones
- Spatial constraint definition

✔ Detects topological dependencies
✔ Defines simplification restriction zones

3. Intersection Preservation Logic

- Overlay between contours and hydrography
- Extraction of intersection vertices
- Fixed vertex tagging

✔ Prevents topological rupture
✔ Maintains hydrological continuity

4. Modified Douglas–Peucker Algorithm

- The standard Douglas–Peucker algorithm was adapted to:
- Preserve fixed (topological) vertices
- Apply controlled epsilon tolerance
- Maintain vertex sequence order
- Avoid fragmentation

✔ Reduces redundant vertices
✔ Preserves morphological integrity
✔ Supports recursive constrained simplification

5. Quantitative Spatial Evaluation

Generalization quality is assessed using:

- Vertex count reduction
- Total length comparison
- Hausdorff Distance (geometric similarity metric)

This enables:

- Objective validation
- Scenario comparison
- Parameter calibration
